# SPEED PONG!

What?
Pong, but it get faster and faster!
Play against the computer and try to beat it (you can't)

Why?
This project has no purpose, it was purely to investigate .turtle in python and explore how it works.
I made this in a single sitting and it was purely for fun.


designed to run on windows, audio will not work on mac os or linux 

controls are W and S

you lose when the speed of the ball gets an overflow error!
